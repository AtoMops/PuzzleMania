# PuzzleMania 

A PuzzleQuest-Clone written in Java based on JavaFX by Wannabe-Company Meisenberg Productions

Not completely done but should basically work(v17)

Almost all artwork (besides the Meisenberg-Production Label) is stolen from somewhere in the internet (for testing reasons)

You can easily adapt the artwork. I might change to Unity for the next versions.
 
Still beginners might be able to learn some stuff from looking at the code. Have fun. 
 
I recommend the yt-channel of Almas Baimagambetov where I learned a lot
